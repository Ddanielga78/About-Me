## About Me
Hey there! I'm **The Coder Formerly Known as Accountant**, a career accountant turned passionate coder. With a background in accounting and finance, I've spent years working with numbers in various forms—from financial reporting to tax prep—and now I'm channeling that experience into code. After mastering the intricacies of data analytics and automation, I decided to merge my love of hockey with my skills in coding to create a tool for fellow stat geeks like me.

### My Background
I’ve spent years working in accounting, honing my skills in financial reporting, taxation, and data analytics. I hold certifications in Tax Prep, Audit, accounting, nonprofit accounting, and advanced data analytics, and I’ve worked extensively with various accounting software platforms. These days, I’m focused on automation and leveraging my expertise to create tools that make my life easier, and by extension, your life easier.
